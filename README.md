## What is it?

This simple extension copies the URLs of all open tabs and copies the system clipboard with each URL on a single line. 

Some example use cases include:

- Power users with hundreds of tabs can easily create a text backup of all URLs they have open
- When researching a topic, you can quickly record all relevant links without creating bookmarks to manage later
- Save URLs for multiple videos
