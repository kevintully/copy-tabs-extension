# copy-tabs-extension
Firefox extension to copy URLs of all open tabs to the clipboard.

This simple extension copies the URLs of all open tabs and copies the system clipboard with each URL on a single line. Some example use cases include:

- Saving URLs for multiple videos
- Power users with hundreds of tabs can easily create a text backup of all URLs they have open
- When researching a topic, you can quickly record all relevant links without creating bookmarks to manage later.
